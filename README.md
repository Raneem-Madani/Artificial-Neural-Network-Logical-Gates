# Artificial Neural Network Logical Gates
Logical gates are the basis of any modern-day computer. The device you are using to read this article is using them for certain. One of the great things about these gates is their easy interpretability. Many of these gates are named in plain English, such as the AND, NOT and OR gates. Others are written in less familiarly but are still simple.
I have built a GUI using MATLAB to choose between the logic gates. Once selecting the gate, the system should define the network structure (perceptron, or multi-layer network).
* Use backpropagation learning algorithm.
* Give an initial random number for all the weights and biases. 
* Our GUI have a graph showing the classification region after training.
